CSE 590 - Computer Architecture

Project 1: 16 â€“ BIT RISC PROCESSOR

This project includes the designing of 16-Bit RISC processor and modeling of its components using Verilog HDL.
The instruction set adopted here is extremely simple that gives an insight into the kind of hardware which should be able to execute the set of instructions properly.
